# Changelog

## 2026-03-28

RA profile bug fixes; scroll-based lazy loading across all activity pages; Steam progress tab hides perfect games by default; hub activity feed shows achievement description and unified game name styling.

### RetroAchievements

- `RAchievementModal` HC/SC progress bars now show correct percentages — `numDistinctPlayersCasual` and `numDistinctPlayersHardcore` were mistakenly stripped by the pipeline; restored and re-fetched via `--refresh-games` full refresh; `totalPlayersHC` added as a separate denominator for the HC bar; bars hidden when player data is unavailable
- HC/SC labels replaced with `Flame`/`Feather` icons colored to match their respective bar fills (`#ff6b6b` HC, `#546270` SC); label row constrained to `max-w-[180px]` matching the bar so SC aligns to the right edge
- `mostRecentAchievement` now runs through `parseTitle()` — game name in the Overview card renders `baseTitle` and tilde tag badges instead of raw title
- All RA date strings (`"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"` UTC) are now normalized to ISO UTC before `new Date()` parsing, fixing a 7-hour timezone offset for UTC+7 users; applied to both `formatTimeAgo` and `formatDate`

### Steam

- Completion Progress tab hides perfect games (100%) by default; "Show Perfect" checkbox in the toolbar toggles them back in

### Activity

- Combined activity (`/activity/`) heatmap now uses precomputed `heatmap.json` from both platforms merged by day — complete data from mount regardless of loaded chunks
- All three activity pages (RA, Steam, combined) now use `IntersectionObserver` scroll sentinel for lazy loading — next chunk auto-loads when scrolled within 300px of the bottom, replacing the manual "Load more" button on Steam and the silent background streaming on the combined page
- Clicking a heatmap day that isn't in the loaded data auto-loads chunks until the day's achievements are available — implemented on Steam Activity tab and combined activity page (RA already had this)

### Hub

- Activity feed rows now show achievement description between the achievement name and the game line (falls back to achievement name if empty); platform-specific badges (points, rarity) removed in favour of a universal unlock time shown right-aligned on the game row
- Game name color changed to `#66c0f4` (blue) with hover-to-white; subset/tilde tag badges moved inline on the game name row
- Row separator border moved from Tailwind arbitrary-value class to inline style — Tailwind CDN does not reliably process arbitrary classes on dynamically injected HTML

### Completions

- Hub breadcrumb links (`../../`) corrected to `../` — one level deep from root; was breaking on non-root domain deployments

## 2026-03-27

Achievement detail modals for RA and Steam; achievement preview strips on game cards; completions page with hub strip; activity shimmer loading; data restructured with sharded achievement chunks and ~2.4MB pipeline savings.

### Completions

- New `/completions/` page listing all perfect (Steam) and mastered/beaten (RA) games grouped by month under collapsible year headers
- Current year expanded by default; past years collapsed
- Two-level hierarchy: year (bold, lighter) → months (indented with left border, muted) → cards
- Platform filter (All / RA / Steam) and "Also show beaten games" checkbox (default unchecked)
- Mastered and completed unified under single "Mastered" type; HC marker removed from beaten badge
- Each card shows game icon, name, type badge (Mastered / Beaten / Perfect), platform icon, console or last achievement name + rarity subline, and playtime / date
- Shimmer skeleton loading state mirrors year header → month header → card layout
- Linked from hub via completions strip

### Hub

- Completions strip added between platform grid and activity section: `★ Completions | N total · X Perfect · Y Mastered · Z Beaten | [icon] latest game ★ TYPE · time ago | View all →`
- Latest completion shows game icon, name, uppercase type badge, and time ago
- Mobile view simplified to `★ Completions | N total | View all →` — breakdown and latest hidden
- Strip visibility controlled by `completions.visible` in `config.json` (defaults to visible)
- Completions link removed from footer (replaced by strip)

### Activity

- Shimmer skeleton loading state added — heatmap grid, filter bar, day headers, session rows, and achievement rows all shimmer while data loads (previously just showed `Loading…`)

### Pipelines

- RA `games.json` strips unused fields before writing — removes `richPresencePatch`, `imageBoxArt`, `forumTopicId`, `flags`, `isFinal`, `releasedAtGranularity`, `numDistinctPlayers*`, `userCompletion*` from game objects and `memAddr`, `authorUlid`, `dateCreated`, `dateModified`, `author` from achievement objects (~1MB saved); `imageIngame` and `imageTitle` were mistakenly stripped in a prior run (causing game card backgrounds to show icons instead of screenshots) — restored to pipeline output
- Steam achievement icon URLs stored as filename hash only in `games.json` instead of full CDN URLs (~1.4MB saved); `achIconUrl(appId, hash)` helper in `helpers.js` reconstructs full URLs at render time; `achievements.json` and `profile.json` continue to store full URLs
- `appId` now embedded in each Steam achievement progress object so the Activity tab can reconstruct icon URLs without a separate lookup

### Structure

- RA data directory renamed `data/retroachievements/` → `data/ra/`
- RA achievement chunk files moved from `data/ra/achievements_N.json` → `data/ra/achievements/N.json`
- `activityHeatmap` extracted from `profile.json` into `data/ra/achievements/heatmap.json`; frontend fetches it separately when the Activity tab opens
- Steam achievements split into quarterly chunks at `data/steam/achievements/N.json` mirroring RA structure; `data/steam/achievements/heatmap.json` added with precomputed day→count map
- `mostRecentUnlock` moved from `achievements.json` into `profile.json` so it's available on mount without loading any chunk
- Steam `ActivityTab` now receives `heatmapData` as a prop (precomputed) instead of deriving it client-side from loaded achievements; chunks lazy-loaded when Activity tab opens
- Steam profile Activity tab now loads one chunk at a time via `loadNextChunk` (matching RA pattern) with a "Load more" button and shimmer skeleton; previously loaded all 4 chunks at once
- Combined activity page (`/activity/`) loads chunk 1 of both RA and Steam first for fast initial render, then streams chunks 2–4 in the background; previously loaded all 8 chunks concurrently on mount

### RetroAchievements

- `RAchievementModal` header now shows subset name as a subtext line (e.g. `Sonic the Hedgehog [Subset - Bonus]`) matching the `GameCard` display
- `GameCard` now shows a preview strip of up to 6 achievement badge icons (unlocked first) with hover tooltips showing name, description, points, and HC badge; clicking opens the detail modal
- `RAchievementModal`: full-screen achievement detail modal with game header (icon, console, status, progress bars), optional genre/developer/released meta row, Status (All/Unlocked/Locked) and Type (All/Progression/Missable) filter rows, and per-achievement rarity ratio badge (UR/VR/R/UC), type icons (Progression/Win Condition/Missable), HC/SC completion bars, and unlock date
- Modal popovers (rarity badge, type icons) use `position: fixed` + `getBoundingClientRect` — escapes the scroll container so tooltips are never clipped regardless of scroll position
- Progress percentage labels on `GameCard` now have text shadow to match Steam

### Steam

- `SteamGameCard` now shows the same achievement preview strip with hover tooltips showing name, description, and rarity gem + label + %; clicking opens the detail modal
- `AchievementModal`: achievement detail modal with game header image, progress bar, Status filter, and per-achievement rarity bar + gem + label + % and unlock date

## 2026-03-26

Combined activity feed launched at `/activity/`, hub gets a recent activity snippet, project restructured under `/profile/` and renamed to `gaming-hub`. Changelog page added.

### Hub

- Activity `app.js` split into `utils/constants.js`, `utils/helpers.js`, and `utils/normalizers.js` (`normalizeRA`, `normalizeSteam`)
- Repo and app renamed from `gaming-profile` to `gaming-hub`; all "Gaming Profile" references updated to "Gaming Hub"
- Changelog page added at `/changelog/` — fetches and parses `changelog.md`, renders releases with collapsible sections, platform color coding, and per-release summaries
- Changelog linked from hub footer

### Pipelines

- RA and Steam workflows now use differentiated commit messages: `update` for incremental, `full refresh` for full game refresh, `unlock refresh` for Steam unlock-only runs
