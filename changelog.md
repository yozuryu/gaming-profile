# Changelog

## 2026-03-27

Achievement detail modals added to both platforms; game cards get an achievement preview strip. Completions page and hub strip added.

### Completions

- New `/completions/` page listing all perfect (Steam) and mastered/beaten (RA) games grouped by month under collapsible year headers
- Current year expanded by default; past years collapsed
- Two-level hierarchy: year (bold, lighter) → months (indented with left border, muted) → cards
- Platform filter (All / RA / Steam) and "Also show beaten games" checkbox (default unchecked)
- Mastered and completed unified under single "Mastered" type; HC marker removed from beaten badge
- Each card shows game icon, name, type badge (Mastered / Beaten / Perfect), platform icon, console or last achievement name + rarity subline, and playtime / date
- Shimmer skeleton loading state mirrors year header → month header → card layout
- Linked from hub via completions strip

### Hub

- Completions strip added between platform grid and activity section: `★ Completions | N total · X Perfect · Y Mastered · Z Beaten | [icon] latest game ★ TYPE · time ago | View all →`
- Latest completion shows game icon, name, uppercase type badge, and time ago
- Mobile view simplified to `★ Completions | N total | View all →` — breakdown and latest hidden
- Strip visibility controlled by `completions.visible` in `config.json` (defaults to visible)
- Completions link removed from footer (replaced by strip)

### Activity

- Shimmer skeleton loading state added — heatmap grid, filter bar, day headers, session rows, and achievement rows all shimmer while data loads (previously just showed `Loading…`)

### Pipelines

- RA `games.json` strips unused fields before writing — removes `richPresencePatch`, `imageTitle`, `imageIngame`, `imageBoxArt`, `forumTopicId`, `flags`, `isFinal`, `releasedAtGranularity`, `numDistinctPlayers*`, `userCompletion*` from game objects and `memAddr`, `authorUlid`, `dateCreated`, `dateModified`, `author` from achievement objects (~1MB saved)
- Steam achievement icon URLs stored as filename hash only in `games.json` instead of full CDN URLs (~1.4MB saved); `achIconUrl(appId, hash)` helper in `helpers.js` reconstructs full URLs at render time; `achievements.json` and `profile.json` continue to store full URLs
- `appId` now embedded in each Steam achievement progress object so the Activity tab can reconstruct icon URLs without a separate lookup

### Structure

- RA data directory renamed `data/retroachievements/` → `data/ra/`
- RA achievement chunk files moved from `data/ra/achievements_N.json` → `data/ra/achievements/N.json`
- `activityHeatmap` extracted from `profile.json` into `data/ra/achievements/heatmap.json`; frontend fetches it separately when the Activity tab opens

### RetroAchievements

- `GameCard` now shows a preview strip of up to 6 achievement badge icons (unlocked first) with hover tooltips showing name, description, points, and HC badge; clicking opens the detail modal
- `RAchievementModal`: full-screen achievement detail modal with game header (icon, console, status, progress bars), optional genre/developer/released meta row, Status (All/Unlocked/Locked) and Type (All/Progression/Missable) filter rows, and per-achievement rarity ratio badge (UR/VR/R/UC), type icons (Progression/Win Condition/Missable), HC/SC completion bars, and unlock date
- Modal popovers (rarity badge, type icons) use `position: fixed` + `getBoundingClientRect` — escapes the scroll container so tooltips are never clipped regardless of scroll position
- Progress percentage labels on `GameCard` now have text shadow to match Steam

### Steam

- `SteamGameCard` now shows the same achievement preview strip with hover tooltips showing name, description, and rarity gem + label + %; clicking opens the detail modal
- `AchievementModal`: achievement detail modal with game header image, progress bar, Status filter, and per-achievement rarity bar + gem + label + % and unlock date

## 2026-03-26

Combined activity feed launched at `/activity/`, hub gets a recent activity snippet, project restructured under `/profile/` and renamed to `gaming-hub`. Changelog page added.

### Hub

- Recent Activity section added: 8 most recent combined achievements with "View all →" link to `/activity/`
- Activity section toggled by `activity.visible` in `config.json`; hidden by default until config loads (no skeleton flash when disabled)
- Hub activity `timeAgo` now shows minute/hour granularity (`5m ago`, `2h ago`) instead of day-only (`today`)
- Steam horizontal overflow on mobile fixed (`overflow-x: hidden` on `html, body`)

### Hub Activity

- New combined activity page at `/activity/` — heatmap, platform filter (All / RA / Steam), timeline grouped by day → game session → achievement
- Day headers are collapsible; click any heatmap cell to filter to that day
- Game sessions show platform icon, game icon, console name (RA only), and unlock time range
- Achievement rows show icon, name, description, and unlock time; left border colored by platform (gold = RA, blue = Steam)
- RA game names parsed for subset and tilde tags; subset badge + name rendered inline in session header
- Heatmap colors switch to gold/blue palette based on active platform filter

### Structure

- Platform profiles moved under `/profile/` — RA at `/profile/ra/`, Steam at `/profile/steam/`
- `/profile/index.html` added as an instant redirect to hub (prevents directory listing)
- `profile.js` renamed to `app.js` across all pages for consistency
- Steam `app.js` split into `utils/constants.js` (`STEAM_STATUS`, `PROGRESS_SORTS`) and `utils/helpers.js` (formatting, URL, and rarity helpers)
- Activity `app.js` split into `utils/constants.js`, `utils/helpers.js`, and `utils/normalizers.js` (`normalizeRA`, `normalizeSteam`)
- Repo and app renamed from `gaming-profile` to `gaming-hub`; all "Gaming Profile" references updated to "Gaming Hub"
- Changelog page added at `/changelog/` — fetches and parses `changelog.md`, renders releases with collapsible sections, platform color coding, and per-release summaries
- Changelog linked from hub footer

### Pipelines

- RA and Steam workflows now use differentiated commit messages: `update` for incremental, `full refresh` for full game refresh, `unlock refresh` for Steam unlock-only runs

## 2026-03-24

Hub rendered dynamically from config file; RA dashboard improvements including lazy-loaded activity, tilde tag badges, and refactored utils; automated data pipeline introduced.

### Hub

- Hub profile data (`username`, `motto`, `tags`, `platforms`) moved to `data/hub/config.json`; `index.html` renders it dynamically

### RetroAchievements

- Want-to-play list now paginates to fetch all items beyond the 500-item API limit

- Stats pills: points shown in gold to improve visual hierarchy

- Game title tilde tags (`~Homebrew~`, `~Hack~`, etc.) displayed as badges across dashboard and hub

### Structure

- Pipeline supports incremental mode (skips cached games) and splits achievement data into quarterly files
- Automated GitHub Actions workflow — fetches data every 3 hours and does a full refresh at midnight, commits results to main
- Scripts reorganized into `scripts/` folder; `package.json` at root with `npm run` commands for all tasks
